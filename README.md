# Bionize
If you have trouble reading, because your focus easily drifts, or maybe because you suffer from dyslexia. Know that you are not alone. Roughly 10% of the whole population deals with reading issues on a daily basis.

Study shows that our brain can read much faster than our eyes allow, and that sometimes we find it hard to find the start of a new word or sentence. That’s why we build a very simple extension, for your browser.

The extension uses the power of bionic reading to transform any large piece of text into something some of us can scan faster, with less effort.

It’s important to note that currently there is no empirical evidence that bionic reading improves everyones reading experience. In fact, some have mentioned having more trouble reading a bionic text.

So why not try it out for yourself and see if reading becomes more enjoyable for you? We would love to hear your experience.
